Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

AirChef is an Airbnb-like marketplace envrionment, where you can both advertise your services and hire a private chef. This app was built using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Cloudinary and hosted on both Github and Heroku.

This app was created in just 5 days by Cara Bell, Fernando Requeni Nacher, Lyubomir Dias and Shaun Lennon at Le Wagon's Web Development Bootcamp. This was our first experience working collaboratively on a project, and building a prototype from scratch.
